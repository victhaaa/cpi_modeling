	Since CPI data can be interpretted as a type of time series data, we decided to proceed with a VARIMA model
	also known as a Vector Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average Model.

	The VARIMA model is a multivariate forecasting algorithm that is used when two or more time series data influence each
	other. In our model, we used the features of past CPI data, PPI data, US Crude Oil prices, and US Gold prices. It is
	modeled as a function of the past values, that is the predictors are nothing but the lags (time delayed value)
	of the series. Compared to ARIMA models, this model is bi-directional, meaning all parameters can be used to
	influence oneother.""")

	In order for the VARIMA model to work, we must test for stationarity. Within modeling,
	 stationarity is when the mean, variance, and covariance are constant and not dependent on time. In other
	 words, our data used for modeling cannot show any clear trends over time. Among all four elements of our
	 data we gathered, they all showed signs of stationarity.
